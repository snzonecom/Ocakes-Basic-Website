    <div class="faq-column">
        <aside>Are deliveries possible?</aside>
        Yes, we do offer same-day deliveries to nearby areas for single orders.
        We currently have Lalamove, Grab, etc. as mode of deliveries.
        For bulk orders and not that nearby to our area, delivery service
        will be negotiated upon transaction.

        <aside><br>Where is the self collection address?</aside>
        Our address where you can pick-up your bento cake(s)
        is to be provided upon transaction.

        <aside><br>What time slots are available for cake pick-ups?</aside>
        Monday to Thursday: 9:00 - 11:00 AM and 2:00 - 6:30 PM
        Friday to Saturday: 10:00 - 11:30 AM and 1:30 - 4:00 PM
        Sundays: Day Off

        <aside><br>How long can the cake last outside?</aside>
        Considering our local weather, 1-2 hours in outdoor areas,
        while 2-3 hours in air conditioned rooms. Please avoid direct sunlight at all times. 
        Also, do note that we do not provide dry ice.

        <aside><br>How long in advance can I place my order?</aside>
        Our website and order form are open every day. Once the slots per month are full, 
        you will not be able to place in any order. 
        Please note that we have a cake orders quota on monthly basis (i.e. slots for December will be opened on any day, until fully booked).

        <aside><br>How do I place an order for custom cakes?</aside>
        You can request for custom cakes through the order form. 
        Once you have submitted the order form, we will reach out to you through sms within our working hours.

        <aside><br>Are you able to recreate the exact design as reference?</aside>
        Nope. We are not able to replicate with 100% resemblance, as custom cakes are a work of art made individually by hands. 
        In addition, we respect the work of other bakers/artists and will not fully replicate their designs. 
        With that, every cake is created specially for you. :)

        <aside><br>Are you able to recreate the exact color shade as reference?</aside>
        We will do our best to get as close as possible. However, just like custom designs, every colour is 
        mixed individually to achieve the desired colour. Most colours require mixing 2 or more different colours. 
        Hence, the final shade may be subject to slight variations. 
        Bear in mind that factors such as photo's lighting and cake temperature may also affect the colour.

        <aside><br>Why is the order form unavailable sometimes?</aside>
        As daily submission is limited, order form will be unavailable once we have reached the daily submission quota. 
        The form will become available again at 12 midnight, unless fully booked.

        <aside><br>Can I change my bento cake design?</aside>
        Unfortunately, we do not allow changes once order is confirmed. 
        This is to avoid possible confusion, as we are a small team managing the overall operation. 
        We greatly appreciate your understanding.

        <aside><br>Can I cancel my order?</aside>
        No cancellation once order is confirmed. Please place your order carefully.

        <aside><br>What are the payment methods?</aside>
        Our mode of payments are bank transfer (any bank), Gcash, and Paymaya.
        
        <aside><br>Is it possible to entertain rush orders?</aside>
        Only if there is an available slot. Once we are fully booked, we are not able to entertain orders in anymore.
