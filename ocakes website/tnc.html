        <aside>Wrong Order, Missing Items.</aside>
        Upon receive of your order, if you discover that there are issues with your order (i.e wrong order or missing items) 
        please immediately inform us through sms, within 60 minutes after collection. 
        ocakes! (bento cake studio) may request for photographic proof and additional information to properly investigate the issue. 
        If we determine that the order and/or goods you received are not of satisfactory condition/quality, 
        we will compensate you for your order or parts of your order.

        <aside><br>Cake Flavour or Cake Texture</aside>
        Cake flavour and texture are subject to each individual's preference. 
        Kindly note that we do ensure that every cake that goes out is of satisfactory quality. 
        Keep in mind that cake's temperature and storing will also affect the quality and texture of a cake. 
        Hence, we will not offer a refund for items that meet our quality standards in terms of flavour/texture.

        <aside><br>Slight Design/ Colour Variations</aside>
        Kindly note that we are not able to replicate a design with 100% resemblance, 
        as custom cakes are a work of art made individually by hands. 
        In addition, we do respect the work of other bakers/artists and will not fully replicate their designs.
        
        <br> Just like custom designs, every colour is mixed individually to achieve the desired colour. 
        Most colours require mixing 2 or more different colours. Hence, the final shade may be subject to slight variations. 
        Bear in mind that factors such as lighting and cake temperature may also affect the colour. 
        Hence, we may or may not offer a partial refund for items with a slight design/ colour variations. 
        Final decision will depend case by case.
